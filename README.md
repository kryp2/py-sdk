## Objective

The BSV Blockchain Libraries Project aims to structure and maintain a middleware layer of the BSV Blockchain technology stack. By facilitating the development and maintenance of core libraries, it serves as an essential toolkit for developers looking to build on the BSV Blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Python 3.10 or higher
pip package manager

### Installation

```bash
pip install bsv-sdk
```

### Development Setup

For contributors and developers, install with test and dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[test,dev]
```

This installs the package in development mode along with all testing and development dependencies.

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from bsv import (
    PrivateKey, P2PKH, Transaction, TransactionInput, TransactionOutput
)


# Replace with your private key (WIF format)
PRIVATE_KEY = 'KyEox4cjFbwR---------VdgvRNQpDv11nBW2Ufak'

# Replace with your source tx which contains UTXO that you want to spend (raw hex format)
SOURCE_TX_HEX = '01000000018128b0286d9c6c7b610239bfd8f6dcaed43726ca57c33aa43341b2f360430f23020000006b483045022100b6a60f7221bf898f48e4a49244e43c99109c7d60e1cd6b1f87da30dce6f8067f02203cac1fb58df3d4bf26ea2aa54e508842cb88cc3b3cec9b644fb34656ff3360b5412102cdc6711a310920d8fefbe8ee73b591142eaa7f8668e6be44b837359bfa3f2cb2ffffffff0201000000000000001976a914dd2898df82e086d729854fc0d35a449f30f3cdcc88acce070000000000001976a914dd2898df82e086d729854fc0d35a449f30f3cdcc88ac00000000'

async def create_and_broadcast_transaction():
    priv_key = PrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY)
    source_tx = Transaction.from_hex(SOURCE_TX_HEX)

    tx_input = TransactionInput(
        source_transaction=source_tx,
        source_txid=source_tx.txid(),
        source_output_index=1,
        unlocking_script_template=P2PKH().unlock(priv_key),
    )

    tx_output = TransactionOutput(
        locking_script=P2PKH().lock(priv_key.address()),
        change=True
    )

    tx = Transaction([tx_input], [tx_output], version=1)

    tx.fee()
    tx.sign()

    await tx.broadcast()

    print(f"Transaction ID: {tx.txid()}")
    print(f"Raw hex: {tx.hex()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(create_and_broadcast_transaction())
```

We welcome contributions that improve test coverage, especially in currently under-tested areas.

### Chronicle Live Tests

The SDK includes a comprehensive live test suite for the Chronicle network upgrade, located in `tests/bsv/live/`. These tests validate real transaction building, signing, script execution, and broadcasting across all sighash flag combinations and script types.

#### Mock Tests (no network required)

250 tests that build real `Transaction` objects, sign them with real keys, and validate every input through the `Spend` script interpreter — without touching the network:

```bash
# Run all mock live tests
pytest tests/bsv/live/ -v -m "not testnet"
```

| Test File | Tests | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `test_live_sighash_matrix.py` | 102 | All 12 sighash flags x 2 tx versions x P2PKH/P2PK/Multisig |
| `test_live_chronicle_opcodes.py` | 43 | 10 restored opcodes (OP_VER, OP_VERIF, OP_2MUL, OP_SUBSTR, etc.) x BIP143 + OTDA |
| `test_live_standard_opcodes.py` | 93 | Stack, arithmetic, bitwise, crypto, flow control opcodes |
| `test_live_malleability.py` | 12 | 6 malleability restrictions x v1-rejects/v2-relaxes pairs |

#### Testnet Broadcast Tests (requires funded key)

98 tests that broadcast real transactions to BSV testnet via ARC, verifying end-to-end correctness:

```bash
# Set funded testnet private key
export FUNDED_TESTNET_WIF="cYourTestnetWifHere"

# Run testnet broadcast tests
pytest tests/bsv/live/test_live_testnet.py -v
```

#### Mainnet broadcast tests (optional, real funds)

Same structure as testnet, but uses mainnet APIs and `.utxo_pool_mainnet.json`. **Costs real BSV**; use a dedicated key.

```bash
export FUNDED_MAINNET_WIF="YourMainnetWifHere"
pytest tests/bsv/live/test_live_mainnet.py -v -m mainnet
```

**How it works:**

1. **UTXO Fan-out**: A single funded UTXO is split into ~130 small outputs via a fan-out transaction
2. **Two-step transactions**: For non-P2PKH scripts (P2PK, Multisig, custom opcodes), a setup tx converts the P2PKH UTXO into the test script type, then a second tx spends it with the target sighash
3. **Spend pre-validation**: Every test tx is validated through the `Spend` interpreter before broadcasting
4. **UTXO persistence**: The UTXO pool is saved to `.utxo_pool.json` between test runs. Failed broadcasts automatically return UTXOs to the pool
5. **ARC headers**: Uses `X-SkipScriptValidation` header to bypass ARC's script validator (which may lag behind the node's Chronicle support)

| Test Class | Tests | Coverage |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `TestTestnetP2PKH` | 24 | P2PKH x 12 sighash flags x 2 tx versions |
| `TestTestnetP2PK` | 24 | P2PK x 12 sighash flags x 2 tx versions |
| `TestTestnetMultisig` | 24 | 2-of-3 BareMultisig x 12 sighash flags x 2 tx versions |
| `TestTestnetChronicleOpcodes` | 20 | 10 Chronicle opcodes x BIP143 + OTDA paths |
| `TestTestnetStandardOpcodes` | 7 | ADD, SUB, MUL, CAT, HASH160, IF/ELSE, CHECKSIGVERIFY |

**Sighash flags tested** (all 12):

| Flag | Value | Algorithm |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `ALL_FORKID` | 0x41 | BIP143 |
| `NONE_FORKID` | 0x42 | BIP143 |
| `SINGLE_FORKID` | 0x43 | BIP143 |
| `ALL_ANYONECANPAY_FORKID` | 0xC1 | BIP143 |
| `NONE_ANYONECANPAY_FORKID` | 0xC2 | BIP143 |
| `SINGLE_ANYONECANPAY_FORKID` | 0xC3 | BIP143 |
| `ALL_FORKID_CHRONICLE` | 0x61 | OTDA |
| `NONE_FORKID_CHRONICLE` | 0x62 | OTDA |
| `SINGLE_FORKID_CHRONICLE` | 0x63 | OTDA |
| `ALL_ANYONECANPAY_FORKID_CHRONICLE` | 0xE1 | OTDA |
| `NONE_ANYONECANPAY_FORKID_CHRONICLE` | 0xE2 | OTDA |
| `SINGLE_ANYONECANPAY_FORKID_CHRONICLE` | 0xE3 | OTDA |
